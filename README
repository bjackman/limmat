BUGS:

 - Worktrees not cleaned up on ctrl-C!

TODOS:

 - Support configuring a shell, with the default based on the user's
   system-level configuration (`getent`).
 - Provide a way to quickly check that tests in your configuration actually work.
 - Support running tests that don't need worktrees.
 - Support re-using worktrees.
 - (Nice to have: avoid creating worktrees if they aren't actually to be used).
 - (Nice to have: let jobs that don't need worktrees start before worktrees are ready).
