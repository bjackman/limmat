# Limmat: Local Immediate Automated Testing

Limmat watches a Git branch for changes, and runs tests on every commit, in
parallel. It's a bit like having good CI, but it's all local so you don't need
to figure out infrastructure, and you get feedback faster.

It gives you a live web (and terminal) UI to show you which commits are passing
or failing each test:
