This audit has been reviewed in https://crrev.com/c/5811890

The crate is fairly easy to read thanks to its small size and rich comments.

I've grepped for `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `\bfs\b`, `\bnet\b`, and
`\bunsafe\b`.  There were no hits (except for a comment in `README.md`
and `lib.rs` pointing out "Zero `unsafe`").

Security review of earlier versions of the crate can be found at

The crate exposes a function marked as `unsafe`, but doesn't use any
`unsafe` blocks (except for tests of the single `unsafe` function).  I
think this justifies marking this crate as `ub-risk-1`.

All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.

This crate has been added to Chromium in https://crrev.com/c/3891618.
